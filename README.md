## Something that I liked.

> In this project, I learned more about RabbitMQ, which was used to make asynchronous calls to the [DevFreela.Payments](https://github.com/vagnerwentz/DevFreela.Payments) repository
> at the time of finalization, when sending a finalization request, in the SQL database, the status of the project was changed to `PaymentPending` and after that, it was sent
> to the file called `Payments` where the DevFreela.Payments repository was listening in the background to this queue, and when receiving it, it executed the necessary code
> for the approval of a payment, and with that, it published again after success, in another queue called `PaymentApproved`, in which this repository
> listened to this queue, and upon receiving the `ProjectId`, it searched the base for this project, and thus changed the project status to `Completed`.
> So there was synchronous communication between the two services.
